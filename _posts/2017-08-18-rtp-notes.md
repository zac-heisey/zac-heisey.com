### Website - [Rebuilding Together Peninsula](http://rebuildingtogetherpeninsula.org/):
- Website is built with [October CMS](https://octobercms.com/):
  - October does have a [plugin library](https://octobercms.com/plugins) to extend functionality
    - Recommend installing some type of [SEO plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugins/search?search=seo)
    - Also recommend installing a [sitemap plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugins/search?search=sitemap) or using an [online sitemap generator](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) for both HTML and XML sitemaps.
- Blog section:
  - Make blog more accessible from main navigation (it's currently buried under _About Us > News Room > From the Blog_)
  - Develop blogging schedule or editorial calendar to help create & publish content more consistently
  - Consider moving blog to a subdirectory (e.g. `/blog`) vs. having it live on a subdomain (`yoursite.wordpress.com`) > This structure has positive SEO benefits.
- Consider installing some heatmapping software across your website to gain a better understanding of how users are engaging with your webpages, which sections they are/are not clicking on, etc.
  - Two heatmapping tools to look into are [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/) and [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)
- Review [Site Auditor](https://marketing-reports.com/rs/brpnI2c/ZgxM8) findings:
 - Focus first on **Meta Issues** and **Duplicate Content Issues**
