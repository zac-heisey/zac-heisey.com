### Website - [yecuganda](http://www.yecuganda.org/):
- Current design and content is outdated, and should be given a fresh look:
  - Site is currently built in Drupal > Any possibility of migrating to WordPress?
    - WordPress is generally considered the most user-friendly CMS, is extremely extendable and customizable, and has a _Huge_ support community to leverage for help.
  - [Header banner image](http://yecuganda.org/sites/all/themes/kristofah/logo.png) should be converted to text if possible (this is better for web crawler readability & SEO).
  - Need to update color of main navigation items (change `#main-menu a` CSS rule to be something other than `color: #fff`).
  - Body content widths need to be adjusted so that all 3 columns display correctly (or consider choosing a theme/layout that isn't 3 columns).
- What are the main goals of the website? Drive donations? Attract more volunteers? Whatever it is, the layout, design, and Calls to Action (CTAs) should reflect those goals:
  - _Capture user info (name, email, phone, etc.) using one of the following WordPress plugins:_
    - [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) (which I believe you already have installed)
    - [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)

  - Heading tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) need to be revised and have color changed to be more visible.
  - Consider moving blog to a subdirectory (e.g. yecuganda.org/blog) vs. having it live on a subdomain (youthequalitycenteruganda.blogspot.com) > This has structure has positive SEO benefits.
  - Need to utilize Yoast SEO plugin (looks like you already have this plugin installed) to optimize title tags, meta descriptions, etc.
