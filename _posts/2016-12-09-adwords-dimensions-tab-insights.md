There are dozens of places in your AdWords account from which you can pull meaningful, actionable insights. The options available for you to slice and dice your paid search data are numerous - so much so that it can be difficult to know where to look first.

One of the first places I look when I take over a new AdWords account, or I'm trying to optimize a campaign for an existing client, is the **Dimensions tab**. This section of your AdWords account can provide some crazy useful information about your PPC performance that you can't really access in other parts of your account.

Below I'll walk you through some of the different types of data (aka "Views") you can access in the Dimensions tab, why it's awesome, and how you can use this information to increase your PPC performance and reach your marketing goals.

## Time
The Time view is perfect if you're trying to learn exactly when people are (and are not) engaging with your ads. The Time view actually consists of several "sub-views," which show performance based on the date, day of the week, quarter, or even down to the hour of the day.

My go-to view here is _Day of the Week_, as it gives me a starting point to understand user behavior based on time (which I can then explore deeper in the _Hour of Day_ view.)

It also helps me pinpoint on which days I should increase/decrease bids and budgets and which I should pause altogether.

## URLs
You'll notice there are two URL-related view options under the Dimensions tab: _Destination URL_ and _Final URL_. Both of these views give you the same information: which of your landing page URLs are is performing best in terms of clicks, impressions, CTR, conversions, etc.

It's a good idea to cross-reference this data with on-page stats for these pages in your Google Analytics account, paying close attention to bounce rate, pages per session, average session duration, etc.

The reason there are two views providing basically the same data is that Google has been working to replace Destination URLs with Final URLs as part of an [upgrade process](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6049217?hl=en&authuser=0) intended to make ad creation and tracking updated much easier for AdWords users.

Moving forward, you'll see less and less data in the _Destination URL_ view as Google works to phase it out, so stick with the _Final URL_ view for review and reporting.

The Dimensions tab sections outlined above are the ones that I find myself using most often. There are some additional sections in the tab (Labels, Top Movers, Free Clicks, etc.) that I don't use very much, but still might have value depending on your marketing goals and AdWords account setup.
