There are dozens of places in your AdWords account from which you pull meaningful, actionable insights. The options available for you to slice and dice your paid search data are numerous - so much so that it can be difficult to know where to look first.

One of the first places I look when I take over a new AdWords account, or I'm trying to optimize a campaign for an existing client, is the **[Dimensions Tab](https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/Articles/What-is-the-Dimensions-tab-and-how-can-I-use-it/ba-p/40658)**. This section of your AdWords account can provide some crazy useful information about your PPC performance that you can't really access in other parts of your account.

Below I'll walk you through some of the different types of data you can access in the Dimensions tab, why it's awesome, and how you can use this information to increase your PPC performance and reach your marketing goals.

- Time
- URLs
 - Dest. URL
 - Final URL
- Keyword info
 - Search terms
 - Paid & Organic
- Geographic info
 - Geographic
 - User Location
 - Distance
- High-level info
 - Campaign / Ad Group details
- Call Details

The Dimensions tab sections outlined above are the ones that I find myself using most often. There are some additional sections in the tab (Labels, Top Movers, Free Clicks, etc.) that I don't use very much, but still might have value depending on your marketing goals and AdWords account setup.
