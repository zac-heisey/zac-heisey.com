### Website - [rockhavennetwork](http://www.rockhavennetwork.org/):
- Current design and content is outdated, and should be given a fresh look.
- Main navigation needs to be redesigned so that it doesn't distract from the content of the page.
- What are the main goals of the website? Drive donations? Attract more volunteers? Whatever it is, the layout, design, and Calls to Action (CTAs) should reflect those goals:
  - _Capture user info (name, email, phone, etc.) using one of the following WordPress plugins:_
    - **[Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) (which I believe you already have installed)**
    - **[Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)**
- Below are some resources to help Rockhaven Ministries research and select a new WordPress theme:
  - **[The 34 best free WordPress themes](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/free-wordpress-themes-712429)**

### SEO/Marketing:

  - _refugee / immigrant assistance_

- Dedicated budget for online marketing efforts?
  - Nothing outside of $10k available via Google Ad Grants (see below).

- Potential partnerships that could be used to leverage online presence?
  - Leverage partnerships for summer, back-to-school, and other events to create content, social posts and mentions, etc.

- Are there specific fundraising efforts, annual events, etc. that could benefit from concentrated, short-term marketing efforts?
  - _List out annual events, programs, etc._


### Social Media:
- FB & Twitter engagement are low and outdated. As discussed, Rockhaven needs to pick this up significantly and stay consistently active on social media. Here are some resources to help:
  - **[The Beginner's Guide to Social Media](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-social-media)**
  - Give **[Buffer](https://buffer.com/)** a try. It's a social media scheduling and management tool that helps you save time and post consistently on Twitter, Facebook, etc.
