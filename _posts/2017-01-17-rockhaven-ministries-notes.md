### Website:
- Homepage design and content could be adjusted to better communicate Rockhaven's mission
  - _Send links to free WP themes_

- Main nav bar needs to be redesigned so that it doesn't distract from the content of the page
- What are the main goals of the website? Drive donations? Attract more volunteers? Whatever it is, the layout, design, and CTAs should reflect those goals
  - _Capture user info (name, email, phone, etc.)_


### SEO/Marketing:
- Technical SEO needs a lot of help:
  - Need to implement Google Analytics:
    - _Send info & link_

  - Need to utilize Yoast SEO plugin (already installed?) to optimize title tags, meta descriptions, etc.
    - _Send info & link_

- What are some specific terms or keyword themes that people might use to discover your organization online?
  - refugee / immigrant assistance
  - job preparation and search assistance
  - housing assistance

- Dedicated budget for online marketing efforts?
  - Nothing outside of $10k available via Google Ad Grants.

- Rockhaven needs to make a commitment to creating high-quality content on a consistent basis. Here are some resources to help:
  - _Share some resources and possible tools to create visual content._

- Get up and running with Google Ad Grants ASAP > That's $10k of free advertising you aren't taking advantage of!
  - _Google Ad Grant setup process, specifics, etc._
  - _Ad Grant Alliance plug_


- Potential partnerships that could be used to leverage online presence?
  - Leverage partnerships for summer, back-to-school, and other events to create content, social posts and mentions, etc.

- Are there specific fundraising efforts, annual events, etc. that could benefit from concentrated, short-term marketing efforts?
  - _List out annual events, programs, etc._


### Social Media:
- FB & Twitter engagement are low and outdated > Need to pick this up significantly
  - _Suggest Buffer to help with consistency_
