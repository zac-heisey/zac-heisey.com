What comes to mind when you hear the words "marketing automation"? Over the last few years, marketing automation has become a buzzword thrown around by those discussing digital marketing strategies, much like "SEO," "Big Data," and "Mobile-First" once were. Beyond the buzz and hype, marketing automation boils down to one simple, yet fundamental business goal: cultivating client relationships.

## Marketing Automation Defined

Officially, marketing automation has been [defined by Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/marketing-automation/) as "a category of technology that allows companies to streamline, automate, and measure marketing tasks and workflows, so they can increase operational efficiency and grow revenue faster." [HubSpot's definition](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-automation-information) echoes this idea, saying that the goal of marketing automation is to "nurture prospects with highly personalized, useful content that helps convert prospects to customers and turn customers into delighted customers."

Did you catch that last bit from HubSpot? The part about turning customers into _delighted_ customers? To me, that's a critical function of marketing automation that will ultimately make or break the success of your entire automation program. Unfortunately, it's also the part of the process that's most often neglected in favor of converting prospects to customers.

## Components of a Well-Tuned Marketing Automation Machine

In this post, we'll be discussing the _process_ of marketing automation, rather than a specific type of software. The process or marketing automation can take many different forms and operate across multiple mediums and channels, depending on the goals, budget, and target audience of the business implementing it. 

In the home improvement and AEC industries, a standard marketing automation system will typically incorporate the following channels and tactics:

- Customized landing pages
- Well-designed lead capture forms
- Personalized email marketing messages
- Segmented drip campaigns based on user behavior, intent, etc.
- Engaging, useful content designed to help, not sell
- A CRM process to track all of this communication (could be a simple spreadsheet or an advanced software platform)

This all seems simple enough, right? Create some landing pages with forms to capture leads, segment these leads into various lists based on specific parameters, and continue to deliver personalized messages, content, and other types of engagement with the goal of nurturing these leads into delighted customers.

## Where Marketing Automation Tends to Fall Apart
 
_TALK ABOUT TIME & PATIENCE, INCLINATION TO OVER-CONTACT AND SPAM, ETC._

**POSSIBLE CLOSING**

Personally, I love marketing automation. The thought of planning, building, and implementing a well-tuned marketing automation program is something I've come to thoroughly enjoy. Because it combines elements of marketing, sales, CRO, design, and engineering, it's a great proving ground for digital "Jacks of All Trades" like myself.
