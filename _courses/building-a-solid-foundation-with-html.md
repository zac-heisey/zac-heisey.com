Nearly every project built for the web relies on Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, as its foundation. HTML is the standard markup language for all websites and web apps, and, when paired with CSS and JavaScript, make up the fundamental technologies of the web as we know it.

If we think of a website or web application as a physical building, HTML would represent the frame and other structural components that give that building shape and support.

When HTML is combined with content — text, images, video, etc. — browsers are able interpret and render our web pages to users.

Below we’ll take a look at the building blocks of HTML (tags, elements, attributes, etc.), as well as explore some more advanced elements like `<form>`, `<link>`, and `<img>`. Once we’ve gotten a handle on basic HTML syntax, we’ll work on properly structuring our HTML document to ensure our markup is properly rendered by browsers.

## Tags and Elements

Tags are the primary building blocks of HTML. They allow us to provide semantic meaning to our content and indicate to browsers how our web pages should be interpreted and rendered.

The specific HTML tags we use will depend primarily on the type of content we’re marking up. When marking up paragraphs of text, for example, we use <p> tags. For heading content, we might use an <h1> tag.

There are tons of HTML tags to choose from, which can make choosing the right one difficult. Don’t worry too much in the beginning about picking the most semantically appropriate tag — it’s more important that you become comfortable with reading and writing HTML syntax first.

If you’re unsure of which types of tags to use in your markup, you can reference this list on MDN web docs, or check out the handy periodic table of HTML elements below:
