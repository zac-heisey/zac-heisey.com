**INTRO**  
NFL football fans are now in that post-Super Bowl, pre-Draft wasteland where free agency rumors fly and player arrest headlines are all we have to hold us over. However, if you're a fan of one of several teams in search of a franchise quarterback, now is also an exciting (and nerve wracking) period of the off season. The pressure is on to identify and land your team's leader for years to come, but the consequences of making the wrong the choice can be _HUGE_ (just ask a Browns fan).

Home remodelers and AEC firms can think of an outside [marketing consultant](https://www.zac-heisey.com) as the quarterback of their marketing strategy. You're hiring an individual (or team of individuals) to help you develop a marketing game plan, direct and lead the other players necessary to carry out that game plan, and ultimately, execute the game plan to perfection.

The question is whether your marketing consultant is a franchise quarterback (think [Jimmy Garappolo](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/2/9/16992104/49ers-contract-jimmy-garoppolo-franchise-quarterback-now-what) - GO NINERS!) or a draft bust (think, well, [every guy on this list](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1047730-50-biggest-quarterback-busts-in-nfl-draft-history)). The answer can mean the difference between year-over-year growth and throwing money down the drain.

Below are a few things to consider when you're trying to make the determination between an all-pro marketing consultant and a flash in the pan dud.

**MAIN POINTS**
- Choose Dependability Over Flash
 - Example of flashy QB (Johnny Manziel?) vs non-flashy but dependable (Tom Brady?)
 - It can be tempting to be swayed by a consultant or agency who wows you with a slick presentation or promises of instant success. In these instances, it pays to do your due diligence and learn more before deciding to work with someone.

 Ask for (and actually contact!) references to get an idea not only of the work they've done, but also _how_ they are to work with. Are they transparent and communicative when you have questions? Do they provide clear and useful reporting, or is it a 10-page report filled with acronyms and graphs that are impossible to decipher?

- Make Sure They're Coachable
 - We've all heard NFL coaches talking about how a player who is "coachable." Basically it means the player is good at taking feedback and criticism, and is willing to put in the time to learn and get better. Your marketing consultant needs to be coachable when it comes to learning about your business, your clients, and your goals.
 - Does your marketing consultant take a 'one size fits all' approach to your AEC firm's marketing needs?
 - A true pro will take the time to learn as much as possisble about your company, your clients, and your goals, combine that with your direct input, and develop a solid strategy to build upon.

- Business Goals vs. Ego Metrics
 - Great Stats (Dan Marino) vs. Super Bowl victories (Eli Manning)
 - Include mention and link to _REAL COMPANY SHIT_ post on Medium
 - Remeber: rankings, traffic, followers, links, etc. are _indicators_ (aka KPIs) of current and/or future success, _not_ the end goal of your digital marketing efforts.

- Think Long Term
 - Compare Ryan Leaf (out of the league in 4 years) to Peyton Manning (18 year career with 2 SB wins & 5 MVP awards)
 - Quick wins are great, but you should approach the relationship with your marketing consultant as a long term partnership geared for ongoing success. Promises of huge traffic spikes or rankings jumps in a short time span are red flags that the consultant isn't in it for the long haul with your business. Even in the digital world, building your brand, establishing relationships, and cultivating loyalty take time and effort.
