**INTRO**  
Football fans are now in that post-Super Bowl, pre-NFL Draft wasteland where free agency rumors fly and player arrest headlines are all we have to hold us over. However, if you're a fan of one of several teams in search of a franchise quarterback, now is also an exciting (and nerve wracking) period of the off season. The pressure is on to identify and land your team's leader for years to come, but the consequences of making the wrong the choice can be _HUGE_ (just ask a Browns fan).

Home remodelers and AEC firms can think of an outside [marketing consultant](https://www.zac-heisey.com) as the quarterback of their marketing strategy. You're hiring an individual (or team of individuals) to help you develop a marketing game plan, direct and lead the other players necessary to carrying out that game plan, and ultimately, execute the game plan to perfection.

The question is whether your marketing consultant is a franchise quarterback (think Jimmy Garappolo - GO NINERS!) or a draft bust (think, well, [every guy on this list](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1047730-50-biggest-quarterback-busts-in-nfl-draft-history)). The answer can mean the difference year-over-year growth and throwing money down the drain.

**MAIN POINTS**
- Choose Consistency Over Flash
 - TBD
 - TBD

- Think Long Term
 - Quick wins are great, but you should approach the relationship with your marketing consultant as a long term partnership geared for ongoing success.
 - TBD

- Make Sure They are Coachable
 - Does your marketing consultant take a 'one size fits all' approach to your AEC firm's marketing needs?
 - A true pro will take the time to learn as much as posisble about your company, your clients, and your goals, combine that with your direct input, and develop a solid strategy to build upon.
