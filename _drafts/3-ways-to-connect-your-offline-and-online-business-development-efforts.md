When you boil it down, business success hinges on one thing: **relationships**. Whether it's with vendors and suppliers, industry partners and peers, staff members, clients, or prospects, relationships serve as the foundation upon which every business is built.

Bad relationships can hamper your company's ability to grow and remain competitive, while good relationships pave the way for long-term progress and increased profits. [Bob Burg](https://burg.com/) sums up the importance of relationships in business beautifully in his book, _The Go-Giver_:

Most people involved in running a business understand this concept and work hard to network, establish connections, be helpful, and cultivate relationships with others in their industry. The strongest of these relationships are usually established in-person, whether it's at a conference, trade show, charity event, job site, or happy hour.

This is great, but too often these relationships are built, maintained, and leveraged exclusively offline. Particularly in industries that are traditionally behind the curve when it comes to integrating digital strategies, companies that fail to leverage their offline relationships in the digital space are leaving valuable opportunities on the table.

Here are three ways to leverage those hard-earned offline business relationships into fruitful digital partnerships that benefit all parties involved.
