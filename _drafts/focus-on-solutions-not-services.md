  Are you hiring outside help to deliver individual services or practical

  your project.

Something that's often overlooked during the selection process of an outside web developer, marketing agency, or business consultant is the prioritization of solutions over services. While it might seem like an argument over semantics, working with a solutions-focused provider can be the difference between realizing your company's goal(s), and simply receiving a stack of deliverables.

Reaching an acceptable solution to a defined problem should _always_ be the goal of any consulting engagement, with services being the means of working towards solutions. It's a much better idea to hire a consultant to help you solve a specific business problem or achieve a desired goal (e.g. earning more web traffic), and work backwards from there, rather than try to pre-determine the services you _think_ your company needs, find a provider, and hope that will help you solve your problem or reach your business objective.

## Why Solutions > Services

For better or worse, **Services** like web development, content creation, SEO, graphic design, etc. have become commodities. They are deliverables that can be secured for lower and lower costs, creating a race to the bottom. While this certainly doesn't mean that all service providers are equal in terms of skill or quality, it does present a problem of perceived value when trying to choose one service provider over another.

**Solutions**, on the other hand, get to the root of a company's pain points to remedy real, long-standing issues or achieve fundamental change within an organization. And because they go beyond the surface level of deliverables, solutions can only be secured through a deep understanding of a company's history, needs, goals, market, customer base, culture, etc.

Take a standard website, for example. As a service, a website is nothing more than a collection of words, images, code, and other digital content delivered to a client for an agreed upon price. As a solution, a website reflects the best aspects of a company in ways that establish rapport, communicate a brand's identity, and hopefully convinces visitors to make a buying decision.

So, do you want a website (service), or better way to attract, nurture, and convert new customers online (solution).

## The Strategy Gap

The gap between **Services** and **Solutions** is **Strategy**. As we've discussed, the commoditization of many digital services means it's easier than ever for non-developers to build their own website, cheap SEO services & online marketing "gurus" are a dime a dozen, and free web-based tools like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/) can turn anyone into a decent graphic designer.

The key to ensuring these services evolve into solutions depends on a sound strategy that outlines _why_ certain services are necessary, _when_ they should be implemented, and _how_ they should be executed.
