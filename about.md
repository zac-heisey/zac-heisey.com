# About ZH Consulting

My name is Zac Heisey and I'm the guy behind ZH Consulting. Since 2007, I've been helping companies build and optimize their websites, establish and grow their digital brands, and earn more business online.

After working on dozens of websites struggling with security issues, outdated plugins, slow load times, and code bloat, I decided to go a different route. Dynamic CMSs like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Squarespace, Wix, etc. can be great - when they're the best tool for the job. For most small businesses, startups, and nonprofits, a big, complex CMS like WordPress is overkill.

At ZH Consulting, we specialize in static web development using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). With these [Static Site Generators (SSGs)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/), we're able to build super-fast, super-secure websites with an intuitive, client-friendly UI that works wonderfully for both developers and content creators.

No plugins. No databases. No security flaws. Just rock-solid websites that look great and work even better. Ready to get your website built? Take a look at [my work](/work) to see if we're a good fit and [get in touch](/#contact)!
