    <p>There are dozens of places in your AdWords account from which you can pull meaningful, actionable insights. The options available for you to slice and dice your paid search data are numerous - so much so that it can be difficult to know where to look first.</p>

<p>One of the first places I look when I take over a new AdWords account, or I’m trying to optimize a campaign for an existing client, is the <strong>Dimensions tab</strong>. This section of your AdWords account can provide some crazy useful information about your PPC performance that you can’t really access in other parts of your account.</p>

<p><strong>[INCLUDE SCREENSHOT OF DIMENSIONS TAB HERE]</strong></p>

<p>Below I’ll walk you through some of the different types of data (aka “Views”) you can access in the Dimensions tab, why it’s awesome, and how you can use this information to increase your PPC performance and reach your marketing goals.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>The Time view is perfect if you’re trying to learn exactly when people are (and are not) engaging with your ads. The Time view actually consists of several “sub-views,” which show performance based on the date, day of the week, quarter, or even down to the hour of the day.</p>

<p><strong>[INCLUDE SCREENSHOT OF TIME VIEW HERE]</strong></p>

<p>My go-to view here is <em>Day of the Week</em>, as it gives me a starting point to understand user behavior based on time (which I can then explore deeper in the <em>Hour of Day</em> view.)</p>

<p>It also helps me pinpoint on which days I should increase/decrease bids and budgets and which I should pause altogether.</p>

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>You’ll notice there are two URL-related view options under the Dimensions tab: <em>Destination URL</em> and <em>Final URL</em>. Both of these views give you the same information: which of your landing page URLs are is performing best in terms of clicks, impressions, CTR, conversions, etc.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to cross-reference this data with on-page stats for these pages in your Google Analytics account, paying close attention to bounce rate, pages per session, average session duration, etc.</p>

<p>The reason there are two views providing basically the same data is that Google has been working to replace Destination URLs with Final URLs as part of an <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6049217?hl=en&amp;authuser=0">upgrade process</a> intended to make ad creation and tracking updated much easier for AdWords users.</p>

<p>Moving forward, you’ll see less and less data in the <em>Destination URL</em> view as Google works to phase it out, so stick with the <em>Final URL</em> view for review and reporting.</p>

<p>The Dimensions tab sections outlined above are the ones that I find myself using most often. There are some additional sections in the tab (Labels, Top Movers, Free Clicks, etc.) that I don’t use very much, but still might have value depending on your marketing goals and AdWords account setup.</p>
