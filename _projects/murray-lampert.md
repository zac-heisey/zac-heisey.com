I've worked with Murray Lampert Design, Build, Remodel for over 10 years, developing, testing, and refining their digital strategy to build a cohesive online brand and deliver more (and better quality) leads. This long-term relationship has led to a deep understanding of Murray Lampert's core values, their ideal client profile, and what it takes to grow their business through digital channels.

We recently spent 6 months redesigning and migrating Murray Lampert's website away from WordPress to a faster, more secure static solution built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Following this major update, we've rebuilt their email marketing automation process so that incoming leads are automatically tracked, segmented, and delivered the appropriate drip campaign with targeted, high-quality content.
