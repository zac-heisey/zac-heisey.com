Forest Green Rovers FC (FGR) are considered to be the greenest football club in the world. Led by Chairman and "green energy" industrialist Dale Vince, the FGR became the first and only football club in the world to be 100% vegan. FGR is also the first club to be certified as carbon neutral by the United Nations.

The club's latest and perhaps most impactful commitment to sustainability is Eco Park, a new 5,000 seat stadium designed by world renowned architects Zaha Hadid. Eco Park will be constructed almost entirely of a timber, creating a first-of-it's kind structure that is both dramatic and sustainable. The building materials, along with landscape features, implementation of green spaces, and creative sustainable energy processes will help make Eco Park a carbon neutral or carbon negative football stadium.

## The Brief

Delays and setbacks in the approval process for Eco Park have led to waning enthusiam for the project among supports and the local community, which has been compounded by the halting of matches due to COVID-19.

FGR is looking for way to revitalize excitement and provide a useful reference guide for the new stadium in order to build support among fans and the local community ahead of an anticipated 2022 opening.

## The Concept

Outdoor advertisements (shops, metro stops, etc.) will be placed throughout Nailsworth and surrounding areas. These adverts will be eye-catching and interactive, and will instruct users to scan a QR code that will launch an immersive AR experience simulating what match day will feel like at Eco Park.

Users will be able to virtually navigate and explore the exterior, interior, seating areas, and pitch of Eco Park on match day. This advanced level of immersion and engagement will build excitement among FGR supporters and provide a more tangible, "real world" connection with Eco Park ahead of its construction. The progressive web app will also include features allowing users to reserve seating in various sections, access more information about Eco Park, and more.

## The Outcome

Initial flows and wireframes were created to map out the user journey from initial engagement through to the AR experience of match day at Eco Park.

Two versions of outdoor advertisement mockups were created, along with several screens depicting the immersive, web-based AR experience that users would be able to navigate via smartphone.

A clickable prototype was also created based on the screen designs to show what a basic version of the Match Day AR experience might be like.
