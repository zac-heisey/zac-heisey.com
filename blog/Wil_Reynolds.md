# Working by the 'Real Company Sh*t' Principle

I've been a fan of Wil Reynolds since my first days as an intern at a newly formed SEO agency. It was 2007, I was fresh out of college, and I had no ideas what "search engine marketing" was. All I knew was that it sounded technical and important when I told my friends and family what I did.

Those initial months on the job were a whirlwind. I had to learn the foundations of a new and constantly evolving industry on the fly, while simultaneously trying to convince clients that I knew what I was talking about. It was rough, but I learned a ton.

During that time, my SEO education relied heavily on articles, tutorials, and resources created by industry gurus - folks like Wil, Rand Fishkin, Larry Kim, Neil Patel, Ginny Marvin, Danny Sullivan, and many others.

Aside from all of the amazing strategies and tactics I’ve learned from these people over the years, there is one core philosophy that’s always resonated with me. It’s Wil Reynolds’ **Real Company Shit (RCS)**, and it changed the way I approached my job as a digital marketer. If you aren’t familiar with Will, or the idea of RCS, it basically boils down to doing things that add _real_ value to a company and help move an organization forward. It means making moves that will benefit a company long term, rather than taking shortcuts and implementing flashy strategies that may yield quick, but ultimately temporary, results.

Wil gives a great breakdown of RCS [here](http://www.seerinteractive.com/services/seo/rcs/).

Perhaps the biggest takeaway for me comes around the 1:40 mark. Wil asks, “Why try to trick Google with what works today, if our clients are trusting us with their brands to build them for the long haul?” Folks who’ve been in the digital marketing industry for awhile - especially those focused on SEO - know what a struggle it’s been to legitimize our work. Fly-by-nighters who specialize in [“black hat”](http://www.wordstream.com/black-hat-seo) techniques in order to get quick wins by gaming the search engines have done a huge disservice to our industry. They've devalued the long term work that _real_ digital marketers are trying to do for their clients, stripping it down to nothing more than link buys, low-quality blogging, and spammy outreach tactics.

Of course, talking about doing RCS and actually convincing a client or your boss that it's worth investing is are two different things. It can be tough to get buy-in for RCS, especially if the decision maker doesn't understand the value in having the digital marketing team lead those types of initiatives. That's why educating clients and decision makers is so critical. Not only is there still _tons_ of dated or straight-up false information around SEO that needs to be quashed, we also need to redefine how success is measured when it comes to digital marketing as a whole.

For, that means a fundamental shift in the things I chose to focus on day-to-day in my work. It means defining what RCS is and what it isn't.

RCS isn't keyword rankings. It isn't PageRank. It isn't backlink profiles or follower counts or anchor text ratios.
