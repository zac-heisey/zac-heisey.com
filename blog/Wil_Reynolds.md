# Working (and Living) by Wil Reynolds' 'Real Company Sh*t' Principle

I've been a fan of Wil Reynolds since my first days as an intern for a newly formed SEO agency. It was 2007, I was fresh out of college, and I had no ideas what "search engine marketing" was. All I knew was that it sounded technical and important when I told my friends and family what I did.

Those initial months on the job were a whirlwind. I had to learn the foundations of a new and constantly evolving industry on the fly, while simultaneously trying to convince clients that I knew what I was talking about. It was rough, but I learned a ton.

During that time, my SEO education relied heavily on articles, tutorials, and resources created by industry gurus - folks like Wil, Rand Fishkin, Larry Kim, Neil Patel, Ginny Marvin, Danny Sullivan, and many others.
